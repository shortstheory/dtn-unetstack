**Everything here is Work In Progress!**

### Overview

Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are used in a number of applications where conventional communication schemes are inadequate due to erratic network conditions, lack of network infrastructure, or long propagation delays in the communication medium. Such networks are famously deployed for space probe communications through satellite relay networks.

In this project, we are attempting to use an adaptation of DTN protocols to improve message delivery in underwater networks using the UNETSTACK software platform. We are developing the protocol to target certain scenarios in which DTNs can have appreciable improvements in the network performance.
